# Tlamim - Selection Process Assistant App

Tlamim is a web application that serves as an assistant for the selection process. It is designed to help streamline the process of selecting candidates. The app consists of a backend written in Python and a frontend built using Node.js.

## Requirements

Before running the Tlamim app, ensure you have the following requirements installed on your system:

- Python >= 3.9
- Node.js

In addition, you will need to set up a Google project and allow it to access both forms and emails. To do this, follow the instructions in [Google Workspace Developer Guide](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/get-started). Once you've completed the setup, add the credentials to the backend folder.

## Getting Started

To get started with Tlamim, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/hadasabraham/Tlamim-project.git

3. Open a new terminal, navigate to the frontend folder, and start the frontend server.
